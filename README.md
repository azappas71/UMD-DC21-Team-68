# Abstract
Within the framework of the World Health Organization’s Quality of Life assessment, public
transit has the potential to impact an individual’s quality of life across several domains, including
their level of independence and environment. The University of Maryland’s Department of
Transportation (DOTS) is uniquely positioned to improve the quality of life of residential and
commuter students by furthering their understanding of VeoRide usage on and around campus.
We hope the insights from our project will help DOTS improve collective well-being. We
investigated the differences in Veoride e-scooter and e-bike traffic between October 2019 and
October 2020 by evaluating changes in the most popular origins and destinations and average
ride length. To investigate we used Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and ArcGIS. We learned that, in
2019, we noticed that VeoRide origins and destinations were concentrated more closely around
academic buildings compared to commercial areas. In 2020, we noticed the average ride length
was minimally shorter, and the popular origins and destinations were diffused across campus.
To leverage this understanding, we propose that more VeoRide stations be created on campus.
If we strategically place more scooters at these locations then students will benefit from
increased mobility and increased transportation options. University of Maryland students and
visitors using open-air transport will increase neighborhood cohesion. With a collective affinity
for the campus, they will sense the importance of preserving our community’s current strengths
and investing in future improvements. Moving forward, we are interested in taking this analysis
one step further to uncover how the built environment contributes to one's quality of life.
